    "- A re-ranker that uses pre-trained [Cross-Encoders](https://sbert.net/examples/applications/cross-encoder/README.html) which can use models from [Hugging Face cross encoder models](https://huggingface.co/cross-encoder) or Hugging Face models that implement a cross encoder function ([example: BAAI/bge-reranker-base](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-reranker-base)).\n",

    "1. Have RedisVL JAR in your classpath\n",
    "2. Have a running Redis Stack instance with RediSearch > 2.4 active\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can run Redis Stack locally with Docker:\n",

    "```bash\n",
